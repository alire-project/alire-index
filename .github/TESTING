The name of the branch plays a role in the tests run when changes are
submitted. For this reason, when modifying the workflows in ./.github, if you
want to test them prior to submission, the PR must be tested against a branch that
exists also in the `alire-index-checks` repo, e.g., 'stable-1.2' or 'devel-1.2'

Normally you'll want to use the latest stable or devel branch.

E.g., if you modify a workflow in the `alire-index` repo and want to test it
privately, you can do so in your own account, but using the same `stable-x.x`
base branch for your private PR.
