        # Needed to be able to diff and obtain changed files. Furthermore, we
        # need the full history or else grafted partial branches confuse the
        # changed files detectors (in both scripts/gh-build-crate.sh and
        # check-author action).

    # For the devel branch we need a compiler available to build alr in
    # setup-alire. We will be able to get rid of this once composite actions
    # support conditional steps.
