The creation of an Excel file is as simple as this small procedure:

```ada
with Excel_Out;

procedure Small_Demo is
  xl : Excel_Out.Excel_Out_File;
begin
  xl.Create ("small.xls");
  xl.Put_Line ("This is a small demo for Excel_Out");
  for row in 3 .. 8 loop
    for column in 1 .. 8 loop
      xl.Write (row, column, row * 1000 + column);
    end loop;
  end loop;
  xl.Close;
end Small_Demo;
```
