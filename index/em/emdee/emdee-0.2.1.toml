# Overview 

`eMDee` is a live performance and rehearsal assistant for musical directors which removes the need to have folders of tracks and command-line windows open in order to play backing tracks for performance groups such as singers, choirs, and theatre-groups.

The MD can plan in advance the order of performance; later, `eMDee` will facilitate the playing of each track in the specfied order during the performance.

Additional controls may be added to specific tracks such as changing the volume level.
