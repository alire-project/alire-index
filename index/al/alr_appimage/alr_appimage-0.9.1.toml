long-description = """
There are two prerequisites for your project to work with this tool:
- It has to be a crate with an `executables` field. Its first value
  has to be the main application program.
- It must be installable using Alire, including all the needed resources.

`alr_appimage` will use the following command for installing it (this requires Alire 2.0):
```shell
alr install
```
Or it will run `gprinstall` inside `alr exec`, if the former fails (Alire 1.x).

If you simply run the tool inside an Alire crate, it will read the
metadata from your `alire.toml` file and create a default AppImage
from it.
