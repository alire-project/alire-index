# We do not want to have system external definitions because in typical systems
# like Debian/Ubuntu only one version at a time can be installed. Hence using
# different versions in different crates/configurations would imply messing the
# users' system. Let them manually configure the compiler they want when they
# do not want one of the pre-packaged Alire versions.
