[Ada OpenAI](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-openai) provides an Ada API to make requests on the
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) models allowing an Ada application to access the [GPT-3](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5),
[GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4),
[DALL.E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e)
and other AI models.

The library was generated by the [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) code generator from the
OpenAPI description of the OpenAI service and it uses the [OpenAPI Ada](https://github.com/stcarrez/swagger-ada) library
to make HTTP requests and perform JSON serialization and deserialization.

## Alire setup

```
alr with openai
```

For the HTTP connection, you can either use AWS or CURL and run one of the following commands:

```
alr with utilada_curl
alr with utilada_aws
```
