Ada Security provides a security framework which allows applications to define
and enforce security policies. This framework allows users to authenticate by using
[OpenID Authentication 2.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html)
as well as [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) protocol.
It allows a web application to integrate easily with Yahoo!, Gitlab, Github, Facebook and
Google+ authentication systems.
The Ada05 library includes:

* An OpenID client authentication,
* An OAuth 2.0 client authentication,
* An OpenID Connect authentication framework,
* An OAuth 2.0 server authentication framework,
* A policy based security framework to protect the resources

The Ada Security library is used by the
[Ada Web Application](https://gitlab.com/stcarrez/ada-awa)
to provide authentication and access control to users within the web applications.
