description = "Ada Industrial Control Widgets Library"
long-description = """
This crate provides a library for designing high-quality industrial control
widgets for Ada applications. The software is based on
[GtkAda](https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gtkada/html/gtkada_rm/index.html),
Ada bindings to [Gtk+](https://www.gtk.org/), and
[cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/index.html).

The key features of the library are:

* Widgets composed of transparent layers drawn by cairo
* Fully scalable graphics
* Support of time controlled refresh policy for real-time and heavy-duty applications
* Caching graphical operations
* Stream I/O support for serialization and deserialization
* Ready-to-use gauge, meter, oscilloscope widgets
* Editor widget for WYSIWYG design of complex dashboards

For further information, visit the
[AICWL website](http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/aicwl.htm).

Maintainer's note:

This Alire crate is packaged in a rather minimalistic way to keep dependencies
on external libraries at a minimum. The crate covers the core functionality of
AICWL, though, so it should be sufficient for most needs.

For example, the original distribution has references to
[Simple Components](http://www.dmitry-kazakov.de/ada/components.htm) which are
not strictly necessary for the core functionality of the library.

Also disabled is the source view widget, which seems to require
libgtksourceview-2, another external dependency. Again, not strictly necessary
to cover the core functionality.

# Object_Dir  = [".", "nested"]
#
# Note: Object_Dir works as follows: If it's ".", it will remain so, if it's
#       "nested", Object_Dir will become roughly obj/{OS}/{arch}/{Development},
#       e.g. "obj/linux/x86_64/debug", all other cases result in Object_Dir
#       being unchanged.
#       Hence we should leave it as is (the default is "."), trusting Alire to
#       set an appropriate one.
