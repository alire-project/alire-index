HQC (Hamming Quasi-Cyclic) is a code-based public key encryption scheme
      designed to provide security against attacks by
      both classical and quantum computers. HQC has been submitted
      to the NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project.

      Adare_HQC256 is a Ada 2012 bind to HQC-256 C.

      Adare_HQC256 has a 512 bits Shared Secret size.
