long-description = """
Dilithium is a digital signature scheme that is strongly secure under
      chosen message attacks based on the hardness of lattice problems
      over module lattices. The security notion means that an adversary
      having access to a signing oracle cannot produce a signature of a
      message whose signature he hasn't yet seen, nor produce a different
      signature of a message that he already saw signed. Dilithium is one
      of the candidate algorithms submitted to the
      NIST post-quantum cryptography project.

      Adare_Dilithium5 is a Ada 2012 bind to Dilithium5 C.

      (C version at https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean)

      How a Bonus all Ada packages in this lib is "Ada Pure"! :-)
