To open a wallet,\nit is necessary to unlock one of these 7 slots by providing the correct\npassword.  Wallet key slots are protected by the user's password\nand the PBKDF2-HMAC-256 algorithm, a random salt, a random counter\nand they are encrypted using AES-256.\n\nValues stored in the wallet are protected by their own encryption keys\nusing AES-256.  A wallet can contain another wallet which is then\nprotected by its own encryption keys and passwords (with 7 independent slots).\nBecause the child wallet has its own master key, it is necessary to known\nthe primary password and the child password to unlock the parent wallet\nfirst and then the child wallet.\n\n## Documents\n\n* [Ada Keystore Guide](https://ada-keystore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [PDF](https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-keystore/blob/master/docs/keystore-book.pdf)\n\n"
