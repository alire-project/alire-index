**PDF_Out** is an Ada package for producing easily and automatically PDF files, from an Ada program, with text, vector graphics and raster graphics.

![Ada PDF Screenshot](https://apdf.sourceforge.io/pw_ari_parcel_m.png "Screenshot of a page produced by PDF_Out")

* Ideal for the dynamic production of reports, invoices, tickets, charts, maps etc.
* Vector graphics
* Inclusion of JPEG images
* Object oriented
* Task safe
* Endian-neutral
* Multi-platform, but native code build
* Standalone (no dependency on other libraires, bindings, etc.; no extra component needed for running)
* Unconditionally portable code: OS-, CPU-, compiler- independent code
* Pure Ada 95: this package can be used in projects in Ada 95, Ada 2005, Ada 2012 and later language versions
* Free, open-source 

The creation of a PDF file is as simple as this small procedure:

```ada
with PDF_Out;

procedure Small_Demo is
  pdf : PDF_Out.PDF_Out_File;
begin
  pdf.Create ("small.pdf");
  pdf.Put_Line ("This is a very small demo for PDF_Out...");
  pdf.Close;
end Small_Demo;
```
