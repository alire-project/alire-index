Zip-Ada is a free, open-source programming library for dealing with the Zip compressed archive file format.
The full sources of Zip-Ada are in Ada, compilable on every compiler and for every system (*).

Key features of Zip-Ada:

* Files and streams supported, for archives and entries, for compression and decompression
* Task safe
* Endian-neutral
* Standalone
* Zip methods supported for compression: Reduce, Shrink, Deflate, LZMA.
* Zip methods supported for decompression: the above methods, plus: Implode, Deflate64, BZip2
* Library is in pure Ada 2005 (nothing compiler/system specific), can be used in projects in Ada 2005, Ada 2012 and later versions of the language
* Unconditionally portable (*)
* Tests and demos included

The library includes a standalone generic streaming LZMA encoder and decoder
(can be used outside of the Zip archive context).
