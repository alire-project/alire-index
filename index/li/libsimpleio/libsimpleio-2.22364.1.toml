Introduction
============

This crate provides an Ada binding to the [Linux Simple I/O
Library](https://github.com/pmunts/libsimpleio), *aka* **libsimpleio**.

*Note: This crate includes all of the functionality of the **`mcp2221`**
and **`remoteio`** crates. Unlike those two crates, which can be built
for and used on Linux, MacOS, or Windows targets, this crate can only be
built for and used on Linux targets.*

Linux Simple I/O Library
========================

**libsimpleio** is an attempt to encapsulate (as much as possible) the
ugliness of Linux I/O device access. It provides services for the
following types of I/O devices:

-   [Industrial I/O
    Subsystem](https://wiki.analog.com/software/linux/docs/iio/iio) A/D
    (Analog to Digital) Converter Devices
-   [Industrial I/O
    Subsystem](https://wiki.analog.com/software/linux/docs/iio/iio) D/A
    (Digital to Analog) Converter Devices
-   GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins
-   Raw HID (Human Interface Device) Devices
-   I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Bus Devices
-   PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) Output Devices
-   [Remote I/O
    Protocol](http://git.munts.com/libsimpleio/doc/RemoteIOProtocol.pdf)
    Devices
-   Serial Ports
-   SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Bus Devices
-   [Stream Framing
    Protocol](http://git.munts.com/libsimpleio/doc/StreamFramingProtocol.pdf)
    Devices
-   TCP and UDP over IPv4 Network Devices
-   Watchdog Timer Devices

**libsimpleio** exports a small number of C wrapper or shim functions.
These shim functions present a more coherent API (Application
Programming Interface) than Linux kernel **`ioctl()`** services and the
myriad other different Linux device I/O API's. The **libsimpleio** shim
functions are designed to be easily called from Ada, C++, C#, Java,
Free Pascal and other programming languages.

The **`man`** pages specifying the **libsimpleio** API (Application
Programming Interface) are available for viewing at
<http://git.munts.com/libsimpleio/doc/libsimpleio.html>.

Ada Binding for the Linux Simple I/O Library
============================================

The Ada binding consists of several software component layers.

The bottom software component layer consists of the **C shim functions**
discussed in the previous section.

The next software component layer consists of **binding packages** that
declare the C shim functions as Ada procedures. Each of the binding
packages corresponds to a single C source file (*e.g.* package
**`libadc`** corresponds to **`libadc.c`**). Each of the C shim
functions are declared as external Ada procedures using
**`pragma Import`**. The Ada procedure names do not necessarily match
the C function names (*e.g.* the C function **`ADC_Open()`** is declared
as Ada procedure **`libadc.Open`**). Many of the binding packages also
declare constants as well (*e.g.* **`DIRECTION_INPUT`** in
**`libgpio.ads`**).

With very few exceptions, you will never need to directly call any of
the procedures nor reference any of the constants declared in the
**`libxxx`** binding packages.

The next software component layer consists of **object packages** that
declare OOP (Object Oriented Programming) object types and methods for
each of the I/O subsystems. This layer uses Ada interface types,
access-to-interface types, and private tagged records extensively.

For example, the package **`GPIO`** defines an interface type
**`PinInterface`**, an access to **`PinInterface`** type named
**`Pin`**, and primitive operation subprograms **`Get`** and **`Put`**.

The child package **`GPIO.libsimpleio`** declares a private tagged
record type **`PinSubclass`** that *implements* **`GPIO.PinInterface`**,
subprograms **`Get`** and **`Put`** that are required to implement
**`GPIO.PinInterface`**, and a constructor function **`Create`** that
returns an **`GPIO.Pin`** access value.

Every package that implements **`GPIO.PinInterface`** will also declare
a constructor function **`Create`** that returns **`GPIO.Pin`**.

This architecture allows code similar to the following fragment:

    MyPins : array (1 .. 3) of GPIO.pin;

    GPIO(1) := GPIO.libsimpleio.Create(...);
    GPIO(2) := GPIO.UserLED.Create(...);
    GPIO(3) := GPIO.PWM.Create(...);

The three GPIO pins can be stored in the same array and manipulated in
exactly the same manner even though the hardware implementation for each
pin is radically different.

The topmost software component layer consists of **device packages**
that implement support for particular I/O devices and are built upon the
lower layers. Most of the device packages correspond to integrated
circuits, such as the [PCA9534 I2C GPIO
Expander](https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ic-spi-serial-interface-devices/ic-general-purpose-i-o/8-bit-ic-bus-and-smbus-low-power-i-o-port-with-interrupt:PCA9534).
A few implement support for boards or modules, such the [Grove
Temperature
Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature-Sensor.html)
module.
