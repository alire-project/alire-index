long-description = "This is a small native Ada library that provides few special functions like Beta, Gamma and Beta Incomplete. I wrote this because I needed those functions, therefore at the moment only the functions that I needed are present. This is a pure native Ada library and there is no dependence on external FORTRAN libraries."
