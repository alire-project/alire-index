This library offers formally verified functions to convert character streams into the smallest standard type representation the resulting number may fit in.
The allowed formats are based on the [JSON-Number format](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), with the addition to allow single underscores between digits.

**Note:** Only decimal based numbers are supported!

**Examples:**

```
-10_000 -> Standard.Integer
1.0 -> Standard.Float
1e4 -> Standard.Float
```
