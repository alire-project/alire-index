# Using raylib-ada

This project is available in the [Alire package manager](https://alire.ada.dev).
To use it, just add `raylib` in your dependencies:
```console
$ alr with raylib
```

And add the following linker switches for executable projects to link against
Raylib and libmath:
```
   package Linker is
      for Switches ("Ada") use ("-lraylib", "-lm");
   end Linker;
```

# Raylib dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian

When Raylib is available in the system distributions (Arch, Fedora, Msys2,
Macports, Brew, etc.), Alire will install it for you so there's nothing to do
here.

For Ubuntu/Debian on the other hand, you have to download a Raylib release from
GitHub (or build from source if you want).

Alire will let you know with a message like this:
```
warn: The following external dependencies are unavailable within Alire:
warn:    libraylib^5
warn: They should be made available in the environment by the user.
```

Download the 5.0 release from this address:
```
$ wget https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/download/5.0/raylib-5.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Extract it:
```
$ tar xf raylib-5.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Set the environment variables like so:
```
$ export C_INCLUDE_PATH=${PWD}/raylib-5.0_linux_amd64/include/:${C_INCLUDE_PATH}
$ export LIBRARY_PATH=${PWD}/raylib-5.0_linux_amd64/lib/:${LIBRARY_PATH}
```
